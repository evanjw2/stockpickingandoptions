Black Scholes model is a mathematical equation used to estimates the theoretical value of derivatives based on other investment instruments, taking the impact of time and other risk factors into account. The use of the Black Scholes model app is to open up a pop up which allows users to input all the necessary variables into the Black-Scholes equation that's used to calculate the fair price or theoretical value of an asset. 
Some assumptions that are made are that the Black-Scholes model assumes that the option is a European-style option and can only be exercised at expiration.
It also assumes that no dividends are paid out during the option's life, that market movements follow a random walk and can't be predicted, that there are no transaction costs involved in buying the option, that the risk-free rate and volatility of the underlying option are known and constant, and that the prices of the underlying asset follow a log-normal distribution.
